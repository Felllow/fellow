            <li>
              Colour scheme:
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color:#75A3BF;"></span>
                  #75A3BF
                  <p>The choice of blue as the primary color in the brand's color scheme aligns with the values of connection, simplicity, and solidarity. Blue is often associated with loyalty and security, creating a sense of trust and reliability for the target audience. Additionally, the color blue, resembling the sky and ocean, brings a feeling of stillness and calmness, which is essential for seniors who may experience feelings of isolation or disconnect. By using this blue color, we aim to inspire positivity and confidence in seniors while maintaining a connection to nature.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color:#D9B88F;"></span>
                  #D9B88F
                  <p>The Fellow beige chosen as a secondary color complements the primary blue color. It represents comfort and simplicity, which are key values for the brand. Being an earthy tone, it evokes stability and familiarity, further emphasizing the importance of building a reliable and inclusive community. The combination of blue and beige creates a harmonious and approachable visual experience for seniors, encouraging them to engage with the brand and its digital environment.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Font choices:</li>
			  <h1>DM Serif Display</h1><p>The DM Serif Display font used for titles conveys a sense of class and a classic image. This choice resonates with our target audience and their familiarity with traditional design elements, creating a sense of trust and reliability.</p>
			  <h2>Rubik</h2><p>The Rubik font, chosen for subtitles, represents a more subtle modern style. It invites the target audience to a world of simple curated technology, embracing the brand's value of making technology easy and accessible for seniors. The combination of classic and modern font choices creates a balanced and inclusive visual language that appeals to seniors while keeping them connected with contemporary design trends.</p>
			  <h3>Noto Sans KR</h3><p>For the body font, Noto Sans KR was selected. It implies simplicity and stability, aligning with the brand's values. Its readability and straightforwardness ensure that the content is easily accessible and comprehensible for seniors, promoting a user-friendly experience.</p>
			
<li>User interface pattern:</li>
                 <p>To emphasize on our values of simplicity and connection, we did not make use of complex interface patterns like carousels. Instead, we implemented a simple structure aand a permanent menu on the left side to facilitate navigation. We strive towards accessibility, by prioritizing a straightforward and intuitive user experience to ensure that seniors can easily navigate the digital environment, which ultimately contributes to their mental and emotional well-being.</p> 
<li>The structure of the navigation and content: <p>Staying along the lines of simplicity, we strived towards an easy and straightforward website. Everything can be found under one page, as to avoid confusion and a series of clicks that can lead our target audience astray. Our product is one of the first things accessible as our webpage is mainly a web shop for our product. A payment process follows it immediately to avoid discouragement of our clients by the process of a convoluted payment system. All of our design choices reflect our product value proposal: A straighforward, simple and reliable process and technology. </p>

          <h3 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h3>
          <p>In the campaign of Fellow, we try to envision the brand values of the company. What is most important to us is showing that we are able to connect them to the benefits of the digital world,  and focus on enlarging the circle of elderly people and, with that, improve their companionship.</p>
          <p>The promotional activities that were executed were;.</p>
		 
                <li>Showing the struggles that our target group might have</li>
                <li>Showing the effect and benefits of our platform</li>
                <li>Telling a possible userâ€™s story</li>
				<li>Clarifying how important we find the privacy </li>
				<br>
					
		<p>We tried to showcase this in a simple and recognizable manner, in order for our target group to understand.</p>
			<p><b> Communication Objectives:</b></p>
<li>Setting up our brand image</li>
		    <li>Setting up awareness for our product</li>
				<br>
				
				
				  <p><b>Objectives</b></p>
		 
<li>Reach: We want to reach 500 elderly people of 65+ between the period of 14th of March and 13th of April. </li>
                <li>Affect: Make our target group feel heard</li>
                <li>Response: Talk about our brand, create interest for our product, invest money and buy our product. </li><br>
					
					  <p><b>Platforms used</b></p>
		 
<li>Facebook: 41% of 65+ is on Facebook; most accessible platform for our target group </li>
                <li>YouTube: Platform they will most likely cross besides Facebook, most used video platform </li>
                <li>Word-to-Mouth; Surroundings can recommend this to our group </li>
					
				
				
          <h3 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h3>
          <p>During the duration of the project, we learned a lot about the marketing aspect of the campaign. Specifically, we discovered that Facebook reels are an excellent way to generate a lot of views and reach a wider audience. However, we also found that people tend to click away quickly from reels, which means that we need to grab their attention within the first few seconds.</p>
			<p>We discovered that our target group, which is the 70+ demographic, is not particularly active on social media platforms. While we were able to reach some individuals within this age range through social media, it was not as effective as we hoped.</p>
			<p>Lastly, we also learned that it is challenging to gain new followers on Facebook, especially without paid advertising. Although we were able to increase our followers, most of them are from our own social circle. It was challenging to achieve significant growth without boosting posts or running ads.</p>
			<p><b>What worked and what didnâ€™t? </b></p>
			<p>What clearly worked were the reels on Facebook, this by far provided us the most reach, with combined a reach of 2300. Besides that, we have a total of 1500 engagements. The success of these reels contrasted with the rest of the posts. On YouTube, the reels and normal videos didnâ€™t catch up in the algorithm. On Facebook, the photos received some interactions but the reach was low. Concluding; the reels on Facebook were the biggest success, but didnâ€™t fully engage the audience.</p>
			<p>Also we had some ideas in the content calendar that we found later werenâ€™t really fitting/possible, so not all the post ideas on the calendar have been posted.</p>
			
					
			<p><b>What went as expected and what didnâ€™t? </b></p>
			<p>Before posting, we already expected that Facebookâ€™s algorithm would be way more successful than YouTubeâ€™s and this turned out to be true. What we didnâ€™t expect was that the reels on Facebook would be so successful. Because of this, we also tried posting the same reels as a short on YouTube, but this didnâ€™t catch nearly as much buzz. We also knew that we would have a pretty good following because of our social circle, but we didnâ€™t expect getting followers from people that we didnâ€™t know.</p>
			<p>Besides that, we wanted to have a word-to-mouth effect, but beforehand we already expected that that effect would be hard to determine because there is no linkable data to this. Although, seeing the reach that weâ€™ve gained we expect that a small percentage of that did connect it to their elderly close ones.</p>
					
			<p><b>What would you do differently?  </b></p>
			<p>When comparing the content calendar to the actual posts, itâ€™s visible that we didnâ€™t fully follow it, this mightâ€™ve had a negative influence on the viewership etc. So we would schedule it better beforehand in order to have it all at the right times. </p>
			<p>Besides that, we doubted between focusing on targeting the target group specifically, or the family involved with our target group. In retrospective, there mightâ€™ve been a chance that that wouldâ€™ve been more successful</p>
					
				  <p><b>Comparing to the Communication and Media Plan;</b></p>
		 
<li>We differed too much from the content calendar in terms of the specific times and this means the learning point here is making more use of the ability to schedule posts. Also not all the posts got out as the proposed titles in the calendar. </li>
                <li>We havenâ€™t reached our goal of getting an amount of clicks from our Facebook to the website, we unfortunately had very low directions to the website, so we shouldâ€™ve made more content referring to our website and made it sooner in order to have the target group get used to our website</li>
                <li>Besides that, the total reach and engagement goal of the content calendar for YouTube didnâ€™t come close. We wanted a reach of 1040 but came close to 100, and the engagement goal was 242 but we got 60. The reach and engagement goal of the content calendar for Facebook were succeeded. We wanted a reach of 1200 and 242 engagements and we received a reach of 2689 and 1771 engagements. This means that we learnt YouTube is way harder platform to promote our brand on.</li>
			
          <h3 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h3>
          <p>We have set up a certain reach, following, and acknowledgement of our brand, but there have to be more steps made to really reach our target group.</p>
<li>Firstly, there should be a more thorough insight in the product and the proâ€™s in comparison with the competitors</li>
<li>Besides that; the times should be more following the content calendar; making it more consistent and more fitting to our target group</li>
                <li>Also, if there would be a possibility to; find a way to advertise in newspapers and or tv/radio, as this would have a way bigger chance of connecting with the target group directly, as they like to use these traditional forms of media more than the social media platforms</li>
					<li>Of course, weâ€™d recommend putting funds in boosting posts to increase the reach; we could boost the reach per post up to 800 if we put in 14 euros for example</li>
						
          
          <p><br>We could have approached the assignment differently depending on the circumstances. For instance, With no extra thorough inside information about the product or service, we could have conducted more extensive research to gather data that can guide in our marketing strategy. Additionally, looking at more competitors it could have helped identify what they are doing well and what gaps exist that our product or service can fill. To ensure consistency in our marketing efforts, it's essential to develop a content calendar that outlines what content will be shared on which platform and to consistently follow it. Finding ways to advertise on radio and TV could also have been an effective way to reach a broader audience. Finally, boosting funds could have enabled us to invest in more extensive marketing campaigns and resources, such as hiring a marketing agency or creating higher quality content. By taking these approaches, we could have developed a more robust marketing plan that is well-informed, consistent, and impactful.</p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Problem:</p>
          <ul>
            <p>The main problems after having the problem interviews for elderly people living alone are mobility issues, limited digital skills, and difficulty connecting with new people and family for several reasons: <br><br>
<strong>Mobility issues:</strong> As people age, their physical abilities decline, making it challenging for them to move around independently. This can lead to increased isolation, as they may be unable to leave their homes or participate in social activities. <br><br>
<strong>Limited digital skills:</strong> The internet and digital devices have become an essential part of modern life, and many people use them to stay connected with family and friends. However, elderly people may not have grown up with these technologies, making it difficult for them to use them effectively.<br><br>
<strong>Difficulty connecting with new people and family:</strong> As people age, they may lose touch with friends and family members or have difficulty forming new relationships. This can lead to increased social isolation and loneliness, which can negatively impact their mental health and well-being.<br><br>
Therefore, it is important to address these issues to improve the quality of life for elderly people living alone. Providing resources and support for mobility, digital skills training, and social connection can help them stay engaged and connected with their communities and loved ones.</p>

</ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution:</p>
          <ul>
           <p> The solution that we have is there to reduce social isolation: <br><br>
Elderly people who live alone and have limited mobility may have difficulty connecting with others, leading to feelings of social isolation and loneliness. A product that helps them connect with others through our digital device can help reduce these negative feelings. They can talk to new people and to their family while still at home and donâ€™t need to have a high level of digital skill. </p>

</ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments:</p>
          <ul>
           <p>The segment for our customers is structured like this because all of these aspects put in the lean canvas fit perfectly with what we as a brand provide.</p>
</ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unique value proposition:</p>
          <ul>
            <p>Our unique value proposition is written down like this because we believe that this is the strongest and most valuable aspect we have of our brand. Because it is about connecting elderly people and to combat the loneliness.</p>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unfair advantage:</p>
          <ul>
            <p>The unfair advantage we have on other brands is because of the simplicity we provide while still being a digital device. The connection can be found right in your own home so without leaving the house if you are unable to.</p>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Channels:</p>
          <ul>
            <p>We chose Facebook and YouTube to be our main channels because after having done research these were the most used for our target group.
<a href="https://documentcloud.adobe.com/spodintegration/index.html?locale=nl-nl"> https://documentcloud.adobe.com/spodintegration/index.html?locale=nl-nl </a>
</p>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Key metrics:</p>
          <ul>
            <p>The main way to see how successful our platform are the subscriptions. They can be measured by looking at the amount that you have.<br><br>
Besides that we can look at the downloads in the app. Downloads can be measured by looking at the amount of downloads the app has (the family can download the app on their phone so they can connect with the elderly people having our physical device)
</p>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Revenue streams:</p>
          <ul>
            <p>We use subscriptions because of elderly people that want to have the device donâ€™t have to buy it so that if unfortunately they pass away, the device can go to another user because they donâ€™t own the device.  After doing the solution interviews most of the interviewees accepted that the monthly fee is 15 euros per month.
The funds are for the start up to really be on the right track from the start.
</p>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure:</p>
          <ul>
            <p>After having done research, this is the average of the costs that we have. These are the sources for the costs, links are on the names: <br><br>
<a href=" https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/amsterdam-it-service-desk-salary-SRCH_IL.0,9_IM1112_KO10,25.htm">Service desk employee salary:  </a><br>
<a href="https://www.paylab.com/nl/salaryinfo/production/service-technician" >Technician salary </a> <br>
<a href="https://shorturl.at/fvOY0"> Price for a tablet to adjust:</a> <br><br>  
SERVICE DESK EMPLOYEE: <br>
While looking at the source you will see that the average salary for a service desk employee is 3230 euros and we think the average of services needed (calls, complaints, questions) every month is 30. 3230 divided by 30 = 107,66<br><br>

TABLET:<br>
Also looking at Coolblue the average price for a tablet and then adjusting it will be around 200 euros.<br><br>
TECHNICIAN:<br>
At last, the average salary for a technician is 3000 euros. An employee works around 40 hours a week. 40 x 4 weeks = around 160 hours a month. 3000 euros: 160 hours = 18,75. The average on working on a installation for a tablet = 2 hours. 18,75 x 2 = 37,50. The costs for an employee installing one tablet = 37,50.<br><br>
TOTAL:<br>
Combining all these costs it comes out at 345,16 euros cost per unit.
</p>
</ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Services/products:</p>
          
            <p>The product is a digital device in a form of a tablet that can be set up on a tv but also just on the tablet. The device is set up by a technician and giving all the instructions beforehand so that the elderly person can use it immediately with the right information. On this device there are not a lot of buttons so that the consumer can use it very easily. At the start they can filter who they want to see and who they donâ€™t want to see. They can call their family but also meet new people on the platform to gain connections. <br><br>
This contributes to the unique value proposition because itâ€™s connecting elderly people together to build a community but also talk to family without having to leave their house.<br><br>
Our brand is all about community, connection, simplicity and guidance. Our product does exactly what our brand is about. They fill in all of our values that we have as a brand.

          <h3 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h3>
          <p><strong>Regular check-ins:</strong> Regular check-ins by phone, text, or video call can help elderly people feel connected and valued. Family members, friends, or volunteers can make these check-ins to ensure that the individual is doing well and to offer emotional support.<br><br>
<strong>Social programs:</strong>  Social programs such as senior centers, community groups, and volunteer organizations can provide elderly people with opportunities for social interaction and engagement. These programs can include activities such as group exercise classes, book clubs, game nights, and cultural events.<br><br>
<strong>Pet therapy:</strong>  Pet therapy can provide companionship and emotional support for elderly people living alone. Adopting a pet or participating in a pet therapy program can help combat loneliness and improve overall well-being.<br><br>
<strong>Technology training:</strong>  Providing elderly people with technology training can help them stay connected with loved ones and access online resources. This can include teaching them how to use social media, video calling platforms, and other digital communication tools.<br><br>
<strong>Volunteer programs:</strong>  Volunteer programs that pair elderly people with volunteers for regular social visits can provide companionship and help combat loneliness. These programs can include friendly visitor programs, senior pen pal programs, and intergenerational mentoring programs.
