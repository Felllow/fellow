              Colour scheme:
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color:#75A3BF;"></span>
                  #75A3BF
                  <p>The choice of blue as the primary color in the brand's color scheme aligns with the values of connection, simplicity, and solidarity. Blue is often associated with loyalty and security, creating a sense of trust and reliability for the target audience. Additionally, the color blue, resembling the sky and ocean, brings a feeling of stillness and calmness, which is essential for seniors who may experience feelings of isolation or disconnect. By using this blue color, we aim to inspire positivity and confidence in seniors while maintaining a connection to nature.</p>
                </li>

                  #D9B88F
                  <p>The Fellow beige chosen as a secondary color complements the primary blue color. It represents comfort and simplicity, which are key values for the brand. Being an earthy tone, it evokes stability and familiarity, further emphasizing the importance of building a reliable and inclusive community. The combination of blue and beige creates a harmonious and approachable visual experience for seniors, encouraging them to engage with the brand and its digital environment.</p>

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Font choices:</li>
			  <h1>DM Serif Display</h1><p>The DM Serif Display font used for titles conveys a sense of class and a classic image. This choice resonates with our target audience and their familiarity with traditional design elements, creating a sense of trust and reliability.</p>
			  <h2>Rubik</h2><p>The Rubik font, chosen for subtitles, represents a more subtle modern style. It invites the target audience to a world of simple curated technology, embracing the brand's value of making technology easy and accessible for seniors. The combination of classic and modern font choices creates a balanced and inclusive visual language that appeals to seniors while keeping them connected with contemporary design trends.</p>
			  <h3>Noto Sans KR</h3><p>For the body font, Noto Sans KR was selected. It implies simplicity and stability, aligning with the brand's values. Its readability and straightforwardness ensure that the content is easily accessible and comprehensible for seniors, promoting a user-friendly experience.</p>

            <li>User interface pattern:</li>
                 <p>To emphasize on our values of simplicity and connection, we did not make use of compelx interface patterns like carousels. Instead, we implemented a simple structure aand a permanent menu on the left side to facilitate navigation. We strive towards accessibility, by prioritizing a straightforward and intuitive user experience to ensure that seniors can easily navigate the digital environment, which ultimately contributes to their mental and emotional well-being.</p> </li>

          <h3 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h3>
          <p>In the campaign of Fellow, we try to envision the brand values of the company. What is most important to us is showing that we are able to connect them to the benefits of the digital world,  and focus on enlarging the circle of elderly people and, with that, improve their companionship.</p>
          <p>The promotional activities that were executed were;.</p>
		 
                <li>Showing the struggles that our target group might have
                <li>Showing the effect and benefits of our platform
                <li>Telling a possible user’s story
				<li>Clarifying how important we find the privacy 
				<br><br>
					
		<p>We tried to showcase this in a simple and recognizable manner, in order for our target group to understand.</p>
			<p><b> Communication Objectives:</b></p>
			<li>Setting up our brand image
		    <li>Setting up awareness for our product
				<br>
				<br>
				
				  <p><b>Objectives</b></p>
		 
                <li>Reach: We want to reach 500 elderly people of 65+ between the period of 14th of March and 13th of April. 
                <li>Affect: Make our target group feel heard
                <li>Response: Talk about our brand, create interest for our product, invest money and buy our product. <br><br>
					
					  <p><b>Platforms used</b></p>
		 
                <li>Facebook: 41% of 65+ is on Facebook; most accessible platform for our target group
                <li>YouTube: Platform they will most likely cross besides Facebook, most used video platform
                <li>Word-to-Mouth; Surroundings can recommend this to our group
					
				
				
          <h3 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h3>
          <p>During the duration of the project, we learned a lot about the marketing aspect of the campaign. Specifically, we discovered that Facebook reels are an excellent way to generate a lot of views and reach a wider audience. However, we also found that people tend to click away quickly from reels, which means that we need to grab their attention within the first few seconds.</p>
			<p>We discovered that our target group, which is the 70+ demographic, is not particularly active on social media platforms. While we were able to reach some individuals within this age range through social media, it was not as effective as we hoped.</p>
			<p>Lastly, we also learned that it is challenging to gain new followers on Facebook, especially without paid advertising. Although we were able to increase our followers, most of them are from our own social circle. It was challenging to achieve significant growth without boosting posts or running ads.</p>
			<p><b>What worked and what didn’t? </b></p>
			<p>What clearly worked were the reels on Facebook, this by far provided us the most reach, with combined a reach of 2300. Besides that, we have a total of 1500 engagements. The success of these reels contrasted with the rest of the posts. On YouTube, the reels and normal videos didn’t catch up in the algorithm. On Facebook, the photos received some interactions but the reach was low. Concluding; the reels on Facebook were the biggest success, but didn’t fully engage the audience.</p>
			<p>Also we had some ideas in the content calendar that we found later weren’t really fitting/possible, so not all the post ideas on the calendar have been posted.</p>
			
					
			<p><b>What went as expected and what didn’t? </b></p>
			<p>Before posting, we already expected that Facebook’s algorithm would be way more successful than YouTube’s and this turned out to be true. What we didn’t expect was that the reels on Facebook would be so successful. Because of this, we also tried posting the same reels as a short on YouTube, but this didn’t catch nearly as much buzz. We also knew that we would have a pretty good following because of our social circle, but we didn’t expect getting followers from people that we didn’t know.</p>
			<p>Besides that, we wanted to have a word-to-mouth effect, but beforehand we already expected that that effect would be hard to determine because there is no linkable data to this. Although, seeing the reach that we’ve gained we expect that a small percentage of that did connect it to their elderly close ones.</p>
					
			<p><b>What would you do differently?  </b></p>
			<p>When comparing the content calendar to the actual posts, it’s visible that we didn’t fully follow it, this might’ve had a negative influence on the viewership etc. So we would schedule it better beforehand in order to have it all at the right times. </p>
			<p>Besides that, we doubted between focusing on targeting the target group specifically, or the family involved with our target group. In retrospective, there might’ve been a chance that that would’ve been more successful</p>
					
				  <p><b>Comparing to the Communication and Media Plan;</b></p>
		 
                <li>We differed too much from the content calendar in terms of the specific times and this means the learning point here is making more use of the ability to schedule posts. Also not all the posts got out as the proposed titles in the calendar. 
                <li>We haven’t reached our goal of getting an amount of clicks from our Facebook to the website, we unfortunately had very low directions to the website, so we should’ve made more content referring to our website and made it sooner in order to have the target group get used to our website
                <li>Besides that, the total reach and engagement goal of the content calendar for YouTube didn’t come close. We wanted a reach of 1040 but came close to 100, and the engagement goal was 242 but we got 60. The reach and engagement goal of the content calendar for Facebook were succeeded. We wanted a reach of 1200 and 242 engagements and we received a reach of 2689 and 1771 engagements. This means that we learnt YouTube is way harder platform to promote our brand on.
			
          <h3 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h3>
          <p>We have set up a certain reach, following, and acknowledgement of our brand, but there have to be more steps made to really reach our target group.</p>
					 <li>Facebook: 41% of 65+ is on Facebook; most accessible platform for our target group
                <li>YouTube: Platform they will most likely cross besides Facebook, most used video platform
                <li>Word-to-Mouth; Surroundings can recommend this to our group
          <p>Describe in detail your future recommendations if the campaign would be continued.</p>
          <p>Detail and describe clearly the process of what your would do differently based on you experience on this project related to the marketing assignment.</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-4" class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>
          <p>Present and organize below all social media/online activities of the campaign. Context and material are according to the brand style, image, and vision. Images on the site are of high-quality, readable, and properly designed.</p>
